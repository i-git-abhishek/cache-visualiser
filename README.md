# Cache Replacement Policy Visualizer  

An interactive web-based tool that helps students **learn and explore cache replacement policies** in Operating Systems. The visualizer makes it easier to grasp how different algorithms manage cache by showing each step of the process, including hits, misses, and replacements.  

## 🚀 Key Features  
- Implements multiple cache replacement algorithms:  
  - **LRU (Least Recently Used)**  
  - **FIFO (First In, First Out)**  
  - **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**  
- Step-by-step visualization of cache state changes.  
- Real-time tracking of **hits, misses, and evictions**.  
- Detailed operation log for every access.  
- Performance statistics (hits, misses, hit ratio).  
- Intuitive, responsive UI built with React.  
- Upcoming support for additional policies (**MRU, Random**, etc.).
